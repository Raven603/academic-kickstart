Weiran Yao is a PhD student in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. Before joining MAC, I spent one year working as a research assistant in City University of Hong Kong. I applied social media analytics into the design decision support of Transit-Oriented development in Hong Kong. I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Aircraft Airworthiness from Beihang University in 2016.
